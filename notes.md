### Notes

#### 5.1
* The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 as a way for the scientific community to share information in a faster and easier way, and has since evolved greatly.
* Targeted advertising is intended to help businesses turn a profit, but it incentivizes the collection of private information and has the potential to be abused.
* Machine learning and data mining have greatly benefitted many fields, but their findings are also susceptible to biases and may unintentionally contribute to discrimination.
* Computers have fostered learning and created many beneficial outcomes, but at the same time, has also been a hindrance since not all people have access to them

GitHub Page Actions:
1. Accuracy: in scientific and mathematical settings, computing can help reduce error, but the harm of this can be that we become more lenient and reliable on it and don't check our work as much
  Efficiency: with online access and options to our day-to-day tasks, everything is faster for us, but at the same time keeps us lazy and don't think of other alternatives that don't involve sitting all the time
  Data security: we don't need to worry as much about losing/forgetting hard copies of important information and it is easy to access everywhere, but at the same time this can be prone to hacks.
2. I do agree about the dopamine issue. This is because I have observed that I too go on social media platforms such as Instagram or YouTube and waste my time and get satisfaction from the videos compared to doing my school work, and as a result saw my grades occasionally dip time to time. This matches with the fact that I indulged in tasks that gave me immediate dopamine, which is a pleasure feeling, compared to long-term tasks that lead me to feel the satisfaction later.

#### 5.2
* Demographic (Younger people are more likely to be comfortable with the internet than older people, people with higher levels of education tend to use the internet more than people with lower levels of education)
* Socioeconomic (People with higher incomes are more likely to have quality access to digital tools than people with lower incomes)
* Geographic (some areas allow for more internet access than others, some areas are easier to connect to the internet than others)
* Digital divide is both intra and international issues â†’ more digital devices users in the west
* Ways to reduce digital divide:
  *Schools with the funding and resources can provide devices and/or hotspots to students that need them.
  * Local and national governments can fund businesses that provide internet access to areas that don't currently have access.
  * Governments and individuals can also help support institutions that provide communal internet access, such as libraries.
  * Websites and governments can release educational resources to help newcomers navigate the internet.

By being open to sharing and learning knowledge and data that can allow themselves to understand multiple perspectives through digital devices.
Help share digital devices to fellow peers who don't have access to them so they will be able to get the same learning opportunities as you.
Technically not since that would mean we lose access to certain information and opportunities. Yes, these barriers are in schools and can be established at home too if the organization/place doesn't want users to be accessing certain information.



#### 5.3
* Computing innovation can still reflect biases that exist in society today
* Algorithims are trained data sets and as a result may not include diversity 
* Ways to fight potential bias
      * People can be mindful of the potential for bias and make sure that it is unbiased and representative as possible

* Example of computer bias facial recognition systems are usually trained on men in majority compared to women and minorities 
* Algorithims pick up common patterns, but as a result, can make judgements considered biased, and leads to to certain groups facing unneseccary risks 
* Some of this computer bias can be intentional or by accident 
* It was found that Amazon's recruiting machines to hire was more biased against women 
* Computer biases can be elimated if programs are given a wider range of patterns to analyze 

GitHub Pages Action: 
White Wanda's movements are better recognized by the facial recognition software compared to Black Desi. I don't think they thought it was intentional, but they probably did think there was a lack of diversity in terms of the patterns the HP algorithim was exposed to and as a result can not detect POC people as well. I think this happened because HP was more likely exposed to 


#### 5.4 
* Crowdsourcing is collecting opinions through data submitted on the internet from a variety of people
* Citizen science: a term that describe scientific research that common population helps to conduct, an example of corwdsourcing 
* Crowdfunding: GoFundME, Kickstarter, and Patreon are platforms where people can raise money 
* Human capabilites can be improved and enhaced through collaboration, which possible through computing 
* Crowdsourcing = new model for collaboration --> connecting buisnesses/social cause(s) funding 
* Science has been expanded through citizen science --> many scientists contribute data of their research through their own computing devices
